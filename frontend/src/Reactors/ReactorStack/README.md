# Comments on the General Structure of the Reactor Stack

Reactor stacks are functional components that are self-building based on the props passed into them. They are housed in Reactor Pages, and are composed of an array of OneFieldForms or TwoFieldForms; the type of Form is constructed based on the props passed into the ReactorStack function.

Without going into depth with matters, check out what functional components are for more information on passing props and presentational components.
