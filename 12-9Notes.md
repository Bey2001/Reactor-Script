# Meeting with Dr. Karim 12/9/2022 at 2:50 PM

- Dr. Karim is going to give me the Word doc to update with a "How-To" for the students to use the website, as well as the Python scripts themselves
    - I will have to update this before the semester, in addition to making a YouTube video for the students to follow
    - I also have to adjust it and probably transcribe it to Word to be able to edit it and reformat it
    - Also sent me code to translate to Python from MATLAB
        - Build the tutorial and documents based on that code
        - Make it be legible for a new person to Python

- Design notes
    -
